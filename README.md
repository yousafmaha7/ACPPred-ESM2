# ACPPred-ESM2: Machine Learning and Transfer Learning based Anticancer Peptide Prediction Web Tool
ACPPred-ESM2 is a novel, state of the art, machine learning and transfer learning based web application that employs a pretrained ESM-2 model and AdaBoost classifier to perform anticancer peptide (ACP) classification.
## Features

- Accepts peptide sequences in FASTA format
- Extracts ESM-2 embeddings
- Applies a trained AdaBoost model to classify sequences
- Interactive Streamlit-based UI
